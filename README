Module 5 Update 06/13/2019
Before, our home controller was hardcoded to accepted one request, which it then wired to our view at home.jsp.

What if we want more? 
Here, we config the Controller object to a full scope new model object called alien. We then have our simple home controller ship the values of the alien to our home.jsp.

This is done via the regular expression ${obj.value}

Use sample to test the values in this case.

http://localhost:9090/home?aid=1&aname=David&lang=java

====
Custom Update 2
Adding a project name via the maven, so that we can docker-build from here on.

====
Custom Update 3
Ever bored with the standard output of the tutorials, I decided to add some CSS to spice things up.
